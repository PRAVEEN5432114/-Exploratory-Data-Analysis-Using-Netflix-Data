# 📊 Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🌍 Diving into Netflix’s Global Reach Through Data

This project explores a Netflix dataset focused on **subscription data, user distribution**, and **country-level statistics**. The goal is to understand how a global platform like Netflix **expands, adapts**, and **performs** across different regions.

---

## 🔍 What I Explored

Using Python and libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, I analyzed:

- **📈 Subscriber Trends by Country:** Visualizing which countries contribute the most to Netflix's global subscriber base.
- **💰 Revenue Patterns Across Regions:** Observing how Netflix's earnings vary geographically.
- **📊 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** Comparing user value across different countries and regions.
- **🧾 Plan Types and Pricing Distribution:** Analyzing the variety and cost of subscription models globally.
- **🚀 Growth Rate Trends:** Tracking how fast Netflix has scaled over the years in specific areas.

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

Throughout this project, I sharpened several key data science skills:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Dealt with missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.
- **Time Series & Group-Based Analysis:** Aggregated metrics by year, country, and plan type.
- **Effective Data Visualization:** Created insightful and clear plots to communicate findings.
- **Contextual Thinking:** Interpreted data with an understanding of economic and cultural factors impacting tech adoption.

## 💡 Reflections

This project reinforced a powerful lesson: **simple numbers can tell deep, complex stories**. Netflix’s performance varies dramatically across regions due to **culture, pricing strategy, infrastructure, and user behavior**.

Understanding these patterns isn't just about plotting charts—it's about interpreting them **within real-world context**.
